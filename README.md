When you first start it, it will download all that it needs to run, do not close the windows or shutdown during the process otherwise it may not finish installing everything it needs. 

The first thing you type will take a while for it to process, but it should be faster afterwords.

ctrl+shift+m will hide the GUI, pressing it again will bring it back, if there is a problem with it popping back up, you can run VATTS again, and it will tell you if its running already and give you the option to fix it.
